# Simulation
This program is meant to be a simulator to estimate the probability of rolling a 1 on a die at least 1 time if I roll a die 4 times. I will use 500000 trials. I generated an integer 1-6 to represent a face of a die. I "rolled" the die 4 times for each trial and added up the ammount of times a 1 showed up. I repeated this process 500000 times.
